# Triangle
I believe there is enough information is cyberspace for society to make its own decisions to change the world in a positive 
way. Triangle will be an attempt to do so using social networking and a satellite eye view of the world in order to show the 
world the consequences of our good, bad, individual and collective decisions. This will have to be a colobarative project, among many ppl.
